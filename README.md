niffy examples
=====

A collection of examples of [niffy](https://github.com/inaka/niffy) usage. Nothing particularly useful, but this project should display all the features niffy has.

### How to use?
Just compile with ``rebar3 shell`` and try it out. You might have to play around with the flags on ``erl_opts`` if you are not using MacOS (and god help you if you are using Windows, but it might work, who knows?)

But the interesting thing is in the ``src`` folder anyway (and maybe on the ``_generated/c_src`` one after compiling).

### Contact Us
If you find any **bugs**, **problems** or got any **suggestions** about **niffy**, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/inaka/niffy/issues/new) in the repo (or even a pull request :)). And please, open issues on this repo only when the examples are wrong.
